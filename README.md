SpreeEventInvitation
====================

This extension lets you create events to announce them to visitors. Upcoming events will be shown on the homepage.

Installation
------------

Add spree_event_invitation to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_event_invitation',
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_event_invitation:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

Run rspec

```shell
bundle exec rake
```
